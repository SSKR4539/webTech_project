      <div class="text-justify">
        <p class="mt-0">At the age of nineteen, Avinash approached his father and told him that he wanted to dropout of college and be a photographer. The following day, his father gifted him his first camera. And that was the start of a lifelong commitment to the craft.</p>
        <p>With the support and guidance of ‘the Ashutosh Gowariker – Aamir Khan– Salman Khan’ trifecta he established himself as a celebrity photographer. He remains indebted to Ashutosh Gowariker for giving him the opportunity to assist him and for introducing him to Aamir Khan. He is grateful to both Aamir Khan, for giving him his first break into the mainstream and to Salman Khan, for unconditionally supporting him in the first phase of his career.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear: left;" >
        <p class="text-justify">Avinash enjoys creating the drama inherent in shooting genres like Film Posters as well as Portraiture, Editorial and Fashion where human beings are carefully “arranged”. The expressions on their face, their gestures and moods, their clothes and movements, every detail in fact, is part of the “setup” that sells something; a movie or a product.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <p class="text-justify">Then there’s the whole process of blank to built-up, which poses a unique challenge, where he begins with nothing but bare walls each time. Slowly the paraphernalia of the shoot arranges itself around him. The elements come together one by one – the model, the crew, the make-up artist, lights, wires, stands and finally he and his camera. They create a momentary, buzzing self-contained universe.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Avinash greatly admires Gautam Rajadhyaksha and Richard Avedon. The simplicity of their ./images is echoed across their workflow from uncomplicated lighting, styling and minimal postproduction through to the final image.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Avinash’s body of work includes an array of personalities from Amitabh Bachchan to Arjun Kapoor, from Hema Malini to Sonakshi Sinha and from Ustad Zakir Hussain to Sachin Tendulkar. He has shot for clients from PETA to D’Décor and editorials for Filmfare and L’Officiel, to name a few.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">By nature outgoing and always true to himself, Avinash savors his relationships with people always trying to understand what makes them tick, what makes them comfortable. He extends that same understanding to the celebrities he shoots. He is fortunate to call a lot of them his friends, perhaps because he looks at each of them as individuals.</p>
