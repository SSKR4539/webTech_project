          <h3>Our vision has always been to capture the life and love of the people</h3>

      <div class="">
        <p class="text-justify">Amar quit his job an engineer to pursue his passion for photography. What began as a photo journey of the temples of India, by happenstance became wedding photography. Studio A, Amar’s brainchild, is now a sought after wedding photography studio. He has shot at locations globally including Greece, USA, and Sri Lanka. Their USP is tasteful and stylish premium photographs and videos that are a perfect matrimony of traditional and contemporary. As an entrepreneur, he continues to create brands like Stones and Stories - document temples that are Indian heritage architectural marvels, Toodle - an artistic kids photography studio, Big Short Films - Social Documentaries that infuse the viewer with positivity and humane energy and Discover Tamil Nadu - Short video journeys that inspire viewers to explore lesser known towns and experiences in interior South India.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">We shot our first wedding in 2011, as a one member team. Within a few years we were traveling around the world shooting weddings, getting published, taking workshops, and becoming sought after. It all took flight from one place – YOU. Our vision has always been to capture the life and love of the people we shoot, and surprise them with a delightful experience. The search is always for that intimate moment that flies past in the blink of an eye. And we’ve pretty much mastered the art of capturing it all. We are a team of 25 people that includes photographers, videographers, editors and studio managers sharing the common vision of making the world a better and interesting place, one moment at a time. With 350+ weddings in India and global destinations like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Dubai, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, Paris, Iceland, the USA, etc., if you ask us what’s our best moment, we’d always say it is the one next to come.</p>
