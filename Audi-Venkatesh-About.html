        <p class="text-justify">I strongly believe that your upbringing has a large part to play in the whatever you create. My family always travelled together, finding the smallest of excuses to go discover a new place, live a new experience, and share our stories with the people we meet, so when I became a photographer, that’s what I started doing subconsciously.</p>

A lot of times when I was in a random city and there was no body I knew and I put up a status and someone helped me out. Now I’m on Instagram and Snapchat as well.</p>
